COLLABORATION - hw06

Ben Fisk office hours, 5/17/21: got help with 3 things
 - Tiles weren't showing up properly, so Ben advised me to set things
   at z = 3 within view.cxx in order to bring them to top of screen
 - Was getting a "no such move" error on mouse click. Found out it
   was because program was comparing the screen position  (ex. (200, 100)
   pixels) to the board position, which must be between 0 and 7 in either
   direction
 - Asked for advice on how to make grid_size visible to both view.cxx and
   controller.cxx. Ben advised me to make a function in view.cxx that
   returns the grid size, then call that in controller.cxx

Mae Mastin office hours, 5/20/21:
 - Advised us not to catch the invalid_move error in view.cxx
 - Gave us the advice to look through the connect 4 code to see how
   to display possible next moves
 - Told us we could maybe edit view.cxx from model, even if it's a little
   hacky, because of the restriction that view can't see the private
   members of model, and because we're not allowed to add public members
   to model, per the requirements of the code
