COLLABORATION

- Was helped by TA Ben Fisk in Office Hours. I changed
 part of my malloc() statement from sizeof(vote_count_t) to
 sizeof(struct vote_count)
- Was helped by TA Chris Song in Office Hours. Changed method
  of checking different elements in array from pointer arithmetic
  to array indexing using array[ind]
     - also advised me to iterate through the vc array and
       allocate memory for its string candidate names in a loop
