Arms-length collaboration for hw1:

Lance Go: I gave him verbal, nonspecific advice about
how to use scanf() to return the number of valid inputs.
This helped him understand and write the read_circle()
function.

-Didn't show him my code
-Didn't look at my code while we discussed
-Didn't verbalize any of the specific lines of my code
